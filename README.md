Hi everybody!ðŸ˜Š

I am an IT Headhunter/ Technical Recruiter with 10+ years' experience hiring Digital Profiles providing a recruitment service plan that identifies talent sources in order to meet current business needs, reaching targeted candidates.

As a Human Resources Professional, I have become aware that the market is pushing us to assume a more active role to help companies "being digital" and not just "doing digital".

I greatly enjoy my work. I believe in the quality of our own actions and that continuous improvement raises the bar and takes people and processes to the next level.
